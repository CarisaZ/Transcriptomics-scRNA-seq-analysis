# Transcriptomics-scRNA-seq-analysis

#contains code chunks for transcriptomics final project. The code chunks do not include all the codes that were used for generating the plots in the report since some codes are relatively repetitive, and inputs were substituted for generating new analysis results instead of replicating the entire code chunk and then substitute the inputs.
